The source is a pitch deck for the SFT Token, a cryptocurrency project aiming to finance sustainable tourism and real estate development in the Alentejo region of Portugal. The project addresses the issues of rural depopulation and underutilized land by proposing an eco-tourism resort governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and blockchain transparency. The SFT Token is presented as an on-chain asset with a limited supply, offering holders a significant share of profits, specifically 40% distributed in USDT. The timeline includes a pilot project in Monsaraz in 2025 followed by the main resort construction between 2026 and 2027, emphasizing social inclusion, renewable energy, and local job creation.
